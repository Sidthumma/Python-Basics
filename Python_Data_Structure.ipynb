        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important\n",
        "-> Data structures are organized ways to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. They enable optimized operations like searching, inserting, and sorting. Choosing the right data structure improves program performance and memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples\n",
        "-> Mutable types (e.g lists) allow changes to their content after creation, like my_list[0] = 5. Immutable types (e.g tuples) cannot be altered after creation, ensuring data consistency. For example, my_tuple = (1, 2) cannot be modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python\n",
        "-> Lists are mutable, allowing modifications, while tuples are immutable, providing data integrity. Lists use more memory but support extensive operations, whereas tuples are faster and more memory-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data\n",
        "-> Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, where each key maps to a specific value. They use a hash table internally for fast access. This structure enables constant-time lookups for keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python\n",
        "-> Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values, ensuring unique elements. They provide faster membership testing (in) due to hash-based storage. Use sets when duplicates are not needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list\n",
        "-> A string is an immutable sequence of characters, like \"hello\". Unlike lists, strings cannot be modified in-place, ensuring consistency. Lists are mutable and can hold elements of different types.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python\n",
        "-> Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. This prevents accidental modifications and ensures data stability. They are ideal for fixed collections of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python\n",
        "-> A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Python dictionaries use hash tables internally for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python\n",
        "-> Yes, lists can hold elements of different data types, like [1, \"text\", 3.14]. This flexibility makes lists versatile for various use cases. However, this may affect performance in some scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python\n",
        "-> Strings are immutable to optimize performance and memory use, as shared references avoid duplication. This ensures safety in multi-threaded programs, as strings cannot be altered.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks\n",
        "-> Dictionaries provide faster lookups and retrieval of data by keys, unlike lists that require linear search. They store data in key-value pairs, making them ideal for structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list\n",
        "-> Use a tuple when dealing with fixed data, like coordinates (x, y). Tuples ensure immutability, preventing accidental changes. They are also more memory-efficient than lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python\n",
        "-> Sets automatically discard duplicate values, ensuring only unique elements are stored. For example, {1, 2, 2} results in {1, 2}. This property simplifies handling uniqueness.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries\n",
        "-> For lists, in checks for the presence of a value, requiring linear time. In dictionaries, in checks for a key, leveraging hash tables for faster lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not\n",
        "-> No, tuples are immutable, so their elements cannot be changed after creation. This ensures data stability and prevents accidental modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case\n",
        "-> A nested dictionary is a dictionary containing other dictionaries as values. Example: students = {\"Alice\": {\"age\": 20, \"grade\": \"A\"}} is useful for representing hierarchical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary\n",
        "-> Accessing elements in a dictionary has an average time complexity of O(1) due to hash-based storage. In rare cases of collisions, the complexity can degrade to O(n).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries\n",
        "-> Lists are preferred when order and duplicate values are essential. They are simpler for sequential operations, such as sorting or iteration over elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval\n",
        "-> Dictionaries before Python 3.7 did not maintain insertion order. This affects data retrieval as the sequence is unpredictable. Modern Python preserves order but still optimizes access via keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval\n",
        "-> Lists retrieve elements by index, requiring O(n) for searching values. Dictionaries retrieve values using keys in O(1), making them faster for key-based access.\n"
